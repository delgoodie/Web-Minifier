# Web-Minifier
This application runs in the console: Once you have a folder containing js, css, html, and resources files, 
you can minify it by running: <br> <code>>minify C:\Path\To\Website\Folder </code> <br> <br>
The app will:<br>Clone the folder into your downloads <br>Remove all the js and css files <br>Minify them <br>Put them into your html file <br>Correctly adjust the html contents to link the scripts.

NOTES:
Your main html file must be named index.html

This app WILL NOT modify any of the original code.

You can download the exe and put it in your python folder in paths (mine is C:\Users\wdelgiudice\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python39\Scripts), yours is in Environment Variables

Or if you don't trust me you can download the python script and just run it in your ide or build it.
